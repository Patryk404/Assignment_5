# Synthetic Control Analysis

This repository contains an R-based implementation of the **Synthetic Control Method**, including the main model estimation, robustness checks using placebo tests, and descriptive statistics.

---

## File Overview

### Main Scripts
- **`Code.R`**  
  Main analysis script containing the core synthetic control implementation and primary results.

- **`Library.R`**  
  Loads all required R packages used across the project and data frame. This script should be run before executing any other code.

---

### Placebo Tests
- **`Placebo.R`**  
  Conducts **in-time placebo tests** to evaluate the robustness of the treatment effects over different time periods.

- **`Placebo2.R`**  
  Conducts **in-space placebo tests**, applying the synthetic control method to control units to assess the credibility of the estimated effects.

---

### Descriptive Statistics
- **`Summary.R`**  
  Generates descriptive statistics for the dataset used in the analysis.

- **`summary_stats.tex`**  
  LaTeX output generated by `Summary.R`, containing formatted tables of descriptive statistics.

---

### Project Files
- **`A5.Rproj`**  
  RStudio project file to ensure reproducibility and consistent project settings.

- **`.gitignore`**  
  Specifies files excluded from version control.

---

## Recommended Workflow

1. Run `Library.R` to load all required libraries  
2. Run `Code.R` to execute the main synthetic control analysis
3. Run `Summary.R` to generate descriptive
4. Run `Placebo.R` and `Placebo2.R` to perform robustness checks
